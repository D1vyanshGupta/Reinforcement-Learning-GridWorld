# Reinforcement-Learning-GridWorld

GridWorld is a popular exercise meant for introduction to reinforcement learning. Here, is an implementation of the same where we endeavour to learn the optimal policy or an agent inside the GridWorld, via both **Policy Iteration** and **Value Iteration**. We compare the convergence rates of both the algorithms.

Further, we generate GridWorld of larger sizes and check for convergence of policies using both the algorithms.

**Java Swing** is used for graphically rendering the GridWorld and **JFreeCharts** is used for graph plotting.
